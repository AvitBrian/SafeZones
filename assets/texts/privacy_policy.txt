2.1 Information We Collect

User Account Details:
To enter SafeZones, users have to undergo an authentication process (e-mail and/or SMS authentication). We retain only basic account data to set up and maintain safe user accounts.

Location Data:
For delivery of real-time alerts, the application accesses GPS location data of users. It is used only to trace out danger zones and enhance situational awareness.

User Reports and Feedback:
Where users report that a place is unsafe or rate feedback for an alert, these data are collated and incorporated into our machine learning training of our prediction algorithms.

    Device Information:
Information such as app usage stats, operating system, and device type might be logged to enable optimizations of the application and the end-user experience.

2.2 How We Use Your Information

    Real-Time Alerts:
    Location data is used to generate and deliver immediate safety notifications.

    AI and Predictive Modeling:
    User-generated reports and historical data feed into our machine learning pipeline, improving the prediction of danger zones.

    Service Improvement:
Aggregated and anonymized data helps us to refine the functionality of the app, ensure system stability, and plan for future updates.
